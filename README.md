you will simulate a parking system using semaphores and threads. The parking lot
has a limited number of parking spots and three gates through which cars can enter. Each car will
arrive at a specific time, stay in the parking for a predetermined duration, and exit. The challenge is to
manage the parking spots among the cars arriving at different gates using thread synchronization
mechanisms effectively.
